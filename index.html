<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About me</h3>
I am a quantitative social scientist and survey researcher based in Chicago, IL. Currently, I am a senior data scientist at Nielsen, where I develop methodology for online panels.

I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://polisci.northwestern.edu/">Department of Political Science at Northwestern University</a>, where I specialized in <a href="https://polisci.northwestern.edu/graduate/program-areas/american-politics.html">American politics</a> and <a href="https://polisci.northwestern.edu/graduate/program-areas/methods.html">quantitative research methodology</a>. My research, which has been supported by competitively-awarded university grants and <a href="http://tessexperiments.org/">Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences</a>, has been published in The Journal of Politics, Political Behavior, Political Communication, Political Psychology, and Weather, Climate, and Society, and by Cambridge University Press. 
 
Prior to graduate school, I worked in market research, politics, and the non-profit sector. I was a Fulbright scholar (Indonesia 2011-12) and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of <a href="https://allegheny.edu/">Allegheny College</a> (2010). My first job was on a farm.
