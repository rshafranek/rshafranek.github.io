## Location history data

I’ve been using Google Location History ever since switching to an
Android device in mid-2016. Many people, understandably concerned about
their privacy or just plain creeped out by the concept, turn location
history off, but I appreciate the way it effortlessly creates a record
of my days. It’s like an auto-generated daily diary that eliminates the
hassle of having to write down your deeds by hand.

It’s pretty easy to view your history at <https://timeline.google.com/>,
but I wanted to export my data, analyze it, and create some custom
views.

## Static plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

## Interactive (plotly) plot
