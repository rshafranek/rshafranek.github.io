**TITLE:** Black Values Survey 2024

**ABSTRACT:** For many years, the traditional political industry has focused resources on understanding different types of White voters, from “Joe the Plumber” to “soccer moms.” Despite Black voters’ pivotal role in driving electoral outcomes, the Black community is often treated as transactional turnout targets. 

However, we believe it is important to understand the full civic life of Black people and the Black community. The same level of curiosity afforded other communities should be extended to understanding differences within the Black electorate.

Too often, messages and programs that target Black voters focus only on demographics and therefore fail to take into account the various issues, values, and identities that drive civic engagement behavior by different types of Black voters. To address this gap, we conducted a national survey of registered and unregistered Black adults, discovering five values clusters that help our partners “see” the Black community with a focus on understanding the diversity of values that drive their civic engagement behavior.
